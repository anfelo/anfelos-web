  <h2>Programming Beyond Frontend Web</h2>

  I was having fun building UIs with Javascript, CSS and HTML, until it wasn't
  fun anymore for me. Or maybe it is still fun, but nowadays there are other
  topics that keep me awake at night.
</p>

<p>
  I started my career 7 years ago as a junior web developer. I was the only
  developer with a passion for building user interfaces in my team. They were
  all backend engineers with no motivation on learning CSS and I was consuming
  every possible CSS trick as possible. This was perfect for me because I had to
  design and implement all of the company's internal and external websites plus
  the core applications.
</p>

<p>
  In 1 year I learned about creating an
  <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank"
    >atomic desing</a

  system to compose UIs in a more granular way. I also learned about the
  <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/">BEM</a> naming convention to give
  better meaning to CSS classes used in the HTML templates. I discovered how to
  make my CSS more modular and scalable with the
  <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> style guide. I really enjoyed that
  time and my motivation during those early years.
</p>

<p>
  Hungry for more knowledge, I jumped into the Javascript hype train and learned
  all the frameworks that were available at the moment, React, Vue, and Angular.
  I slowly started adopting some of those technologies in my projects and
  finally I got hired as an Angular developer. Since then, Angular has been my
  main source of income for the past 5 years. However, my curiosity didnâ€™t die
  there, I kept learning other, more simple, frameworks or libraries like
  Svelte, Vue and Solid.js. I found those new technologies fun to learn at first
  but it becomes overwhelming pretty quick because they end up creating a very
  complex and obscure ecosystem that feels like black magic and nobody
  understands how it works under the hood.
</p>

<p>
  I have slowly started to lose interest in the frontend ecosystem. It is kind
  of hard to stay up to date to the latest and fastest framework and the new
  shiny way to do JS bundling. Styling is now preferred with Tailwind but, by
  the time I start learning it, there will be a new one which is better.
  Currently, the hot topics to learn are, how to render JS from the server to
  allow for faster loads of websites and new JS runtimes that promise to be
  faster and more secure than Node.js. All of these things sound interesting but
  I know that is not something that I want to pursue. Maybe my 20 year old self
  would be super psyched to wake up early to get up to speed with those
  technologies, but not anymore.
</p>

<p>
  In my search for the next big thing that I want to focus my learning roadmap
  on, I have discovered that I enjoy doing lower level stuff, like creating a
  video game from scratch, writing code for the game engine itself or creating
  terminal user interfaces for tools. The only thing that continues to be the
  same, is my excitement building user interfaces. I feel that rendering pixels
  on the screen, in the way that I want, and making them interactive is my real
  passion under the hood, no matter which medium, technology, or platform.
</p>

<p>
  I want to stop looking for external influences on what to learn next and start
  looking internally at what makes me happy and what sparks more curiosity in
  me.
