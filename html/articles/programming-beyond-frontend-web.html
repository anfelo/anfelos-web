  <h2>Programming Beyond Frontend Web</h2>

  From all software stuff, the thing that gives more joy is building user
  interfaces. Maybe it's because I love the immediate feedback of coding
  something and watching it display right away. Maybe it's because I enjoy good
  design, color combinations, and element composition. Not sure. It's also very
  similar to the kind of joy I get when I build hardware. When I connect some
  cables to a microcontroller and see an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">LED</a> blinking
  feels good. So maybe it's because it makes software something a bit more
  tangible, and I feel that I can control it.
</p>

<p>
  I have been working as a web frontend for some time now and it still feels
  good to write some HTML and CSS to build some ideas, but I'm currently more
  curious about different ways to express software as a user interface.
  Different ways to paint pixels into a screen.
</p>

<p>
  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy writing JS and playing with CSS to make
  things look the way that I want but nowadays other topics wake me up early in
  the morning.
</p>

<p>
  I started my career 7 years ago as a web developer. I would wake up early
  morning to learn all the known tricks with CSS. During my night I was reading
  books about the inner workings of JS and Web. I was hooked! Shaping websites
  to look the way that I wanted was some kind of drug for me.
</p>

<p>
  In 1 year I learned about creating an
  <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a>
  system to compose UIs in a more granular way. I also learned about the
  <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/">BEM</a> naming convention to give
  better meaning to CSS classes used in the HTML templates. I discovered how to
  make my CSS more modular and scalable with the
  <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> style guide. I enjoyed that time and
  my motivation during those early years. I jumped into SASS and did all that
  thing as well.
</p>

<p>
  Hungry for more knowledge, I jumped into the Javascript hype train and learned
  all the frameworks that were available at the moment, React, Vue, and Angular.
  I slowly started adopting some of those technologies in my projects and
  finally, I got hired as an Angular developer. Since then, Angular has been my
  main source of income for the past 5 years.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, Angular feels like the correct tool but most of the time it just
  feels slow to make progress and it also feels slow to run. It also feels
  overly complicated for no reason. However, my curiosity didn’t die there, I
  kept learning other, more simple, frameworks or libraries like Svelte, Vue,
  and Solid.js. I found those new technologies fun to learn at first but it
  becomes overwhelming pretty quickly because they end up creating a very
  complex and obscure ecosystem that feels like black magic and nobody
  understands how it works under the hood.
</p>

<p>
  The industry moves very fast and one has to keep up to date. I still do, but
  not for the joy of learning, just for the sake of keeping myself employable.
  Every couple of months (or less) the way of doing things in these frameworks
  changes and everyone moves blindly to try to keep up. Then we spend a bunch of
  time refactoring and fixing all the tooling for building, testing, and
  deploying the app that is now "obsolete".
</p>

<p>
  I have started to slow down my progression in learning the new ways of web
  frontend. It is kind of hard to stay up to date with the latest and fastest
  framework and the new shiny way to do JS bundling. Styling is now preferred
  with Tailwind but, by the time I start learning it, there will be a new one
  that shinier and better (or just more popular). Currently, the hot topics to
  learn are, how to render JS from the server to allow for faster loads of
  websites and new JS runtimes that promise to be faster and more secure than
  Node.js. All of these things sound interesting but I know that is not
  something that I want to pursue. Maybe my 20-year-old self would be super
  psyched to wake up early to get up to speed with those technologies, but not
  anymore.
</p>

<p>
  In my search for the next big thing that I wanted to focus my learning journey
  on, I stumbled upon the handmade community, especially the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MollyRocket">handmade hero video series</a>
  by Casey Muratori, where he goes and creates a full video game completely from
  scratch. This different angle to developing software was refreshing for me and
  sparked so much curiosity and motivation. Another site that I found and I’m
  now a huge fan is the
  <a href="https://codecrafters.io/">codecrafters</a> community. It is just a
  collection of challenges to build software from scratch or recreate software
  for learning and enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
  I have discovered that I enjoy doing this type of lower-level stuff, like
  creating a video game from scratch, writing code for the game engine itself,
  or creating terminal user interfaces for tools. The only thing that continues
  to be the same, is my excitement building user interfaces. I feel that
  rendering pixels on the screen, in the way that I want, and making them
  interactive is my real passion under the hood, no matter which medium,
  technology, or platform.
</p>

<p>
  I want to stop looking for external influences on what to learn next and start
  looking internally at what makes me happy and what sparks more curiosity in
  me.
