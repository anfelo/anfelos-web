          Hi, I'm an electronics engineer that got in love with software
          development. I still love to tinker around with hardware, but I don't
          do it as often as I would love to. I love silent mornings with coffee
          and the sound of my keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to nerd ðŸ¤“ about coffee, read books and travel around the world
          ðŸŒŽ.
        </p>
        <p>I'm from Bogota, Colombia but currently living in Hamburg.</p>

                    This is one of my side projects. I'm creating some guides/tutorials
                    on how to build different types of things from scratch.
